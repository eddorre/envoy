A simple, extendable messaging system designed for deployments

Usage

require 'envoy'

# Create a new messenger
messenger = Envoy::Messenger.new

# Define some transports
messenger.transports.each do |transport|
  transport.add_transport(:campfire, :account => 'foo', :token => 'bar', :room => 'my_room')
end

OR

messenger.transport(:campfire, :account => 'foo', :token => 'bar', :room => 'my_room')

# Add some messages
messenger.messages.each do |message|
  message.add_message(:name => 'Start deployment message', :subject => "Carlos started deployment of branch foo to production at #{Time.now}")
  message.add_message(:name => 'End deployment message', :subject => "Carlos ended deployment of branch foo to production at #{Time.now}")
end

OR

messenger.message(:name => 'Start deployment message', :subject => "Carlos started deployment of branch foo to production at #{Time.now}")

# Deliver messages one at a time

messenger.deliver_start_deployment_message

AND THEN

messenger.deliver_end_deployment_message

OR

# Deliver all messages

messenger.deliver_all_messages

Email, Campfire, and Webhook Transports are included. Create your own by inheriting from Envoy::Transport
